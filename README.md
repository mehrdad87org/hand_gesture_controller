1. **Move Image**: Move an image on the screen using hand gestures.
2. **Brightness Control**: Adjust screen brightness using hand gestures.
3. **Volume Control**: Adjust system volume using hand gestures.
4. **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Visualize hand landmarks and connections in real-time.

## How to Use:
1. Run the `hand_gesture_controller.py` file.
2. Use the buttons to switch between "Move Image" and "Brightness/Volume" modes.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to control the application using hand gestures.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

Since some packages of this code have not been published for Python 3.13,
it is better to use Python version 3.12 for better performance.
